# My Blog

This is my blog built with Astro, a really fast static site generator. The blog uses TinaCDN for content management.

I write about anything, here.

## Build your own

1. Clone the template repo (I modified from Openblog):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danielcgilibert/blog-template.git
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
cd blog
pnpm install
  ```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

4. The rest is up to you!
